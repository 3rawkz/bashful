# doc bashful {{{
#
# Bashful is a collection of libraries to simplify writing bash scripts.
#
# It's separated into the following libraries:
#
#     bashful-core
#     bashful-doc
#     bashful-execute
#     bashful-files
#     bashful-input
#     bashful-messages
#     bashful-modes
#     bashful-profile
#     bashful-terminfo
#     bashful-utils
#
# To get full documentation on each, just invoke it at the command line with
# the first argument as 'help'. For example, to get documentation on the input
# library:
#
#     $ bashful-input help
#
# doc-end bashful-doc }}}
