BashUtils is a collection of libraries intended simplify writing bash scripts.

To install, run the 'install' script:

    install [DIR]

This will install the scripts to DIR or to ~/bin, if not specified.

To get documentation:

    bashutils help [COMMAND]

This will display documentation on COMMAND. If no COMMAND is specified,
general help and a list of all libraries/commands will be given.

To get documentation for a specific library:

    bashutils-input help [COMMAND]

This works exactly like the previous documentation command except it is
specific to the input library.

To use within a bash script, simply source the needed library:

    source bashutils-input

At this point, all functions in the input library are available to the script.

To test out a command or to use in a non-bash context:

    bashutils COMMAND [OPTIONS] [ARGUMENTS]

To minimize unnecessary loading of functions, use the library directly:

    bashutils-input question -p "How are you?"
