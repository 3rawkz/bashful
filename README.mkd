Installation
------------

All script filenames have the ".bash" extension, but are intended to be used
as if the extension were removed. I'm assuming that these scripts will be
installed into ~/bin, but you can install them anywhere you prefer, as long as
that path is in your PATH. Unless you know what you're doing, the recommended
way to install this package is to do the following:

1.  Make sure ~/bin is in your PATH.
2.  Copy the needed scripts into ~/bin without the ".bash" extension.

One way to copy all of the scripts would be to do this in a terminal:

    for script in /path/to/this/dir/*.bash; do
        cp $script ~/bin/$(basename $script .bash)
    done
